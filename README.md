# Canny-Edge-Detection-Algo

This program implements a Canny Edge Detection alorithm in Java that takes an image as input and outputs a map of outlines.

The user can specify the fine name of an image(.png or .jpg) file in Driver.java.

Make sure the image is located in the INPUT folder.

It will then create 5 new images that illustrate each step of the algorithm.

It is built only using standard libraries from the java SDK.
